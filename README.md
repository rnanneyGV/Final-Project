# Final-Project
The Final Project incorporates areas of responsibility for a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. Our security engineering team has been asked to create alerts and confirm these alerts are working properly.

As part of this project, we have configured alerts in Kibana, launched a simulated attack on a machine in the network. We have also captured and investigated suspicious activity on the network to identify misuse of corporate resources.

The findings from this project have been summarized in the Blue Team, Red Team, and Network Analysis files located in this repository.
